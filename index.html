            <p>I quickly came to understand that code is a superpower every young woman should be able to access.
                Understanding that code is the underlying (and invisible) framework of tech means that we do not have to
                be passive bystanders in our ever-changing digital world.So everyone should learn coding.

            <p>Corona Tracer BD is an initiative by the ICT Division and DGHS with the objective of bringing the people
                of Bangladesh together in the combined fight against COVID-19.This app utilizes Bluetooth signal to
                understand if you are near another Tracer app user. It will help you in identifying whether you are at
                risk of COVID-19 infection, by checking if you have been in recent contact with an infected individual.
                If your case seems risky, you will be able to seek medical help at the earliest and go into
                self-isolation.The technology is powered by Shohoz Ltd.
